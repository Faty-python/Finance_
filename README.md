Steps to run the code

Step 1: 

Extract the ZIP File
Locate the ZIP file on your system.
Extract its contents to a folder. You can do this using:
Windows: Right-click the file and select "Extract All..."
Mac: Double-click the file to extract it.

Step 2: 

Open the Project Folder
Navigate to the extracted folder. It should contain files like main.py, app.py, config.py, frames.py, functions.py
Ensure all files are in the correct structure. The main file to run should be app.py

Step 3: 

Install modules

If the project uses third-party Python libraries, you need to install them. 
Check for a file 
i.e. customtkinter, pillow, pandas, matplotlib, CTkMenuBar in the folder. 


Step 4: 

Run the Main File

Navigate to the folder where the project was extracted:
Run the main application file (likely main.py) 

Step 5: 

Test the Application
A GUI window should appear, showing the login or main screen of your personal finance manager.
Interact with the application by creating accounts, adding budgets, or performing transactions.




Additional Notes

Configuration File (config.py):
Ensure that SMTP settings and other sensitive configurations are accurate and up to date.
Database Initialization:

The application should automatically create the necessary SQLite database and tables if not already present.
